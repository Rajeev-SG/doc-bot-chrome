# Windsurf Capabilities

1. **Demonstrate Deep Reasoning over Knowledge**

This demonstrates Cascade's abilities to:

- Use tools to search through existing codebases.

- Create multi-file multi-edit changes in a manner that is self-consistent.

- Allow you to accept multiple changes at once.

- **Search**: Cascade will intelligently search through your codebase for snippets relevant to the task that itâ€™s trying to accomplish.

- **Write**: Cascade will write changes for you in your file. Only available in Write mode which can be configured under and to the right the prompt input box.

- **View file**: Cascade will analyze a file to gather more context to help it accomplish the task requested.

- **Terminal**: Cascade has the ability to run both synchronous and background terminal processes. For example, it can generate and run install commands to set up a project as well as a background process to run the project.
2. **Demonstrate Incorporation of Human Actions**

Cascade has the ability to:

- Reason about the actions that you are taking in the text editor and refer to them semantically.

- Be fully operating on the same state of the codebase as you are, without you needing to scope out the problem for a copilot or agent.
3. **Demonstrate Access to Tools**

Cascade has the ability to: 

- Reason iteratively about your existing codebases.
- Suggest terminal commands and execute them within Cascade.
- Debug stacktraces by identifying and reasoning about relevant code.
- Suggest fixes to issues, making edit suggestions directly to your files.
- Allow you to introspect diffs and accept diffs line-by-line.

### Takeaways on Cascade

These should demonstrate the power of the Windsurf Editor to jointly reason deeply about your codebases, access a broad set of tools, and incorporate your own actions as a developer. 

Cascade will not always be perfect, and often you may find yourself asking Cascade follow ups to fix unexpected side effects, or just taking over entirely and ignoring the AI for more complex tasks. That is totally okay! Cascade is the most powerful AI assistant that you can still trust and iterate with.
