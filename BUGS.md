# Known Issues and Future Improvements

## Known Issues

### Content Conversion
- [ ] Complex web pages with dynamic content may not convert correctly
- [ ] Some special characters might not be properly escaped in Markdown output
- [ ] JavaScript-rendered content might not be captured in the conversion

### Storage
- [ ] Local storage limitations may affect users with large numbers of saved entries
- [ ] No automatic backup functionality for saved entries

## Workarounds

### Content Conversion Issues
1. For dynamic content:
   - Wait for the page to fully load before converting
   - Use the scroll-to-bottom feature to ensure all lazy-loaded content is rendered

2. For special characters:
   - Use the "Download Raw" option to get unformatted content
   - Manually clean up any problematic characters in the exported file

### Storage Limitations
1. Regular maintenance:
   - Periodically export and backup important collections
   - Use the bulk download feature to save collections locally
   - Remove unnecessary entries to free up storage space
